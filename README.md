# Guess-The-Celebrity-Game
A game I created using AndroidStudio 2.2.
The code uses a link of some celebrities website I found on the internet (http://www.posh24.se/kandisar), gets it's HTML and parses names
of celebrities and links to images of those celebs.
At each round of the game, the program randomly picks a celebrity from the extracted names, downloads the matching image using the url
found on the HTML, and presents it on the screen.
In addition to the image, 4 celebrities' names also appear on the screen, and the player need to guess who is the celeb in the image.
The goal is to gets correct answers as much as possible!
